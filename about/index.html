<p>
    I'm an experienced systems administrator AND software developer, and has been working in IT for about 20 years. 
    Although I started my carrier as a mostly PC support guy, I never gave up software development which was my passion since the high school years. 
    So even as I went down the rabbit hole of the professional systems engineer's carrier exploring the quirks of various server side technologies, I was using every opportunity to apply my programming skills to extend the systems functionality, script a common admin task or create a fully integrated end-to-end automation solution.
    As a result, I'm sometimes confused as to what I should call myself - a software developer or a systems support engineer :) 
    Honestly, I think I'm both, and I also think that with the current DevOps religion taking over the traditional IT shops with clear dev/ops separation, it does make a lot of sense for systems operations/maintenance engineer to be a good programmer as well.

    For the past few years, my primary focus was on SharePoint, MS SQL and Docker in the systems administration area and on C#, PowerShell and JavaScript (both Node.js and browser environments) for software development.
    The list of server technologies I've come across is below, even if I can't claim expert level knowledge of all of the items:
    <ul class="normal-text">
        <li>Windows Server</li>
        <li>SharePoint Server</li>
        <li>MS SQL Server (DB Engine, Reporting Services and MSIS)</li>
        <li>Active Directory</li>
        <li>ADFS</li>
        <li>Exchange</li>
        <li>Hyper-V</li>
        <li>MS System Center - SCOM, SCSM, VMM, SMA and SCCM</li>
        <li>IT security and authentication, IPsec, log management, cyber forensics</li>
        <li>Linux</li>
        <li>Docker/Docker Swarm</li>
        <li>haproxy and keepalived</li>
